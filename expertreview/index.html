        <h1>Expert Review & Report</h1>
        <section id="one">
            <p>My code was reviewed by Abrar Syed, the graduate student TA for our class. As a graduate student pursuing a masters in CS, his knowledge makes him qualified to review code.</p>
            <p>In our discussion, Abrar mentioned two main things.</p>
            <blockquote>
                1. Condense health bar logic into one function<br>
                2. Group related tasks together
            </blockquote>
            <p>The first was about avoiding repetition, AKA the DRY principle. Calling health bar changes in multiple places with the same code makes it redundant, so it's better to just consolidate it into one function and call that whenever I need to update the health bar. His second suggestion was to put all 'click' event listeners into one function, and just call that in place of where they are right now.</p>
