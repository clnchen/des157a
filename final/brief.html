            <p>The project I’m updating is the Every Picture Project, because I felt like there was more I wanted to expand upon for the zoom section.</p>

            <p>I plan on asking a few people to do usability testing on the project by playing through it a few times.

            <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <p>I plan on focusing on improving the usability of it. Specifically, I want to further gamify it by having users zoom and click on the Smiskis, rather than just hovering over their icons and having the picture zoom by itself. I’m thinking of having one figure appear, telling the user to find and click on the Smiski in the picture. I also want to include user interaction animations, like the Smiski being highlighted with a different color when clicked, or adding sounds to reaffirm that something’s been completed.</p>

            <p>As for design, I’ll probably keep it relatively similar, so as to not take away from the main focus of the project.</p>
