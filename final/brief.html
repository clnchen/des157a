            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>The project I'm updating is the Game On! project, because I felt like there was more I could do to increase player immersion.

            <p>I plan on asking a few people to do usability testing on the project by playing through it a few times.

            <h2>Project Brief</h2>
            <p>I plan on improving usability and visual design of the project. Specifically, I want to further develop it by having more sprite actions and player customization. Right now, the sprites are just gifs, but I want to make them more flexible and controllable by replacing them with spritesheets. I also want the players to be able to pick colors, so that I can further distinguish whose turn it is. My hope is that the game will feel more alive and would offer a better user experience when playing it.
