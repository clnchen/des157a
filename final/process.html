    <p>I wanted to improve <span>functionality</span> to make the game more immersive. I'm planning on updating and adding functions to include sprite animation stages, with an active, idle, fighting, defeat, and celebration stage. The active stage would give the player more visual feedback on which character's turn it is. The celebration, defeat, and fight animations would also reassure users that their action went through. I think this would also make the game feel a lot more alive and immersive. I also want to add player name inputs to the startup overlay, so that the game will feel more personalized and interactive.</p>
