        Hi, this is <span class="adjective"></span> <span class="oNoun" id="name"></span> I just wanted to <span class="adverb"></span> address the recent controversy regarding what I said about <span class="adjective" class="repeat"></span> <span class="pNoun"></span> I never meant any harm, and I have the utmost respect for anyone that is <span class="adjective" class="repeat"></span>. I know my words were <span class="adjective"></span> and <span class="adjective"></span>, and for that I am truly sorry. Everyone here should know that I have 9<span class="adjective"></span> friends, so I understand the <span class="adjective"></span> impact of my actions. 
    </p>

    <p>
        That being said, it is never okay to send <span class="noun"></span>threats. I have been in <span class="location"></span>, <span class="verb" id="vIng"></span> my <span class="oNoun" id="bodypart"></span> out, <span class="adjective"></span> for my life. I am just a <span class="noun"></span>. Put yourself in my <span class="oNoun" id="clothing"></span>. Who knows, maybe one day you’ll <span class="verb"></span> too! Let’s all calm down for a second, and <span class="verb"></span> our <span class="pNoun"></span>. To everyone that came to my page just to tell me to <span class="verb"></span>, thanks for the <span class="pNoun"></span> and <span class="pNoun"></span>!
    </p>

    <p>
        We’re all going to move on from and laugh about this one day, and thank you to my <span class="noun"></span> crew for holding me accountable and sticking by me. Stay <span class="adjective"></span>. Love you guys!
