                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
                
                <p>This was a really interesting article! It described different ways to have a photograph generate thought from the viewers. I think an important takeaway from the article that I had was having your picture be interpretable or opinion-generating. I like the idea of treating it as a game, and having diverse enough elements that each person in a group could leave having noticed a different thing. I also like the idea of photos telling a larger story, in which the context of it can be deduced just from looking at details of the photo. I’m currently taking a different design class in which we talk about how everything is a result of its systems of production, and I feel like that’s especially relevant when it comes to photography.

                <h2>Modal/Overlay/Dialog Window Design</h2>
                
                <p>Pop-up windows are extremely prevalent in web design now, and I’ve definitely encountered both good and bad ones. This article shows some of the considerations that need to be made when designing a modal window, starting with a clear diagram of the basics. I think the biggest thing that stuck out to me was that an exit path should be clearly enforced. In a lot of designs that are used for marketing, exit paths are often obscured or intentionally made small. Another important takeaway is that modals aren’t the most compatible with mobile devices due to the small screen space, and that there are better alternatives to them.

                <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
                
                <p>It’s clear from reading the article that form design is something that requires a lot of consideration. While some projects are targeted towards a specific demographic, all kinds of people encounter forms, and it’s important to design them in a way that’s accessible to and intuitive to everyone. A couple of the notes that stood out to me from the article are labels, placeholder text, and explaining sensitive information. While I hadn’t thought about it in terms of form design, I can also name times where forms have asked for sensitive information and that’s made me not complete it. Another point I found important from the article was rewording so as to not blame the user when something isn’t filled out or is filled out incorrectly. Overall, the article was both interesting and informative, and I would definitely refer back to it when designing a form.

                <p>One form that stands out to me is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> checkout process. There are colorful call-to-actions, the radio buttons are kept to a small number, and there’s a clear flow regarding the order you’re supposed to fill it out.
