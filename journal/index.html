                <h2>Game UX Best Practices</h2>
                

                <p>I thought this article on game UX was really interesting! I was interested in game UX but it definitely felt more out of reach than less specific fields of web design. Reading the article made me realize how many more elements and considerations there are to game UI/UX. For one, a big point of it is marketing. You want to maximize profits, and that can be done through minor things, like making purchases feel more personal, accessible, or positive through associations. Something I never really thought about was including presenters looking at the user for certain pages, and also comfort-reaching zones. I’ve definitely accidentally pressed a lot of ads while playing games or scrolling through apps, so that makes a lot of sense, even if it is a dark practice.</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/mypic.png" alt="mypic">
                    <figcaption>Caitlin Chen, 2023</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This image is interesting because the figures were bought and the pictures were taken in Taiwan. The image of two characters sitting side-by-side on a train doing mundane things like reading a newspaper and taking a nap are reflective of their place of origin, and you can tell by the seats that they were styled after somewhere in Asia. This image is related to my collection of blind boxes! I really like collecting in general, but this one is special to me because my mom and brother also really liked them. It was nice getting to share my hobby with my family. I have a few others of this series (SML), but not specifically these train ones. I’m also pretty sure my brother has one at his house, so in a way, it feels like I’m connected to him through it. I also tend to really enjoy blind boxes with figures that are pictured doing normal things, like Smiskis.</p>

                    <figcaption>Neha Bagepalli, 2024</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>This is an image of a bowl of ramen. I think the most interesting aspect of this image is the variety in color, shape and texture. There are a lot of different elements in one dish, and the green of the vegetables adds visual complexity to the different shades of brown of the egg, soup, and mushrooms. The most obvious aspect of the image is the bowl, because it’s the focus and largest element. I think the most mysterious aspects are the other objects on the table, especially the drink menu on the top. The design of the menu makes you wonder what the vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant are.</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
                
                <p>This was a really interesting article! It described different ways to have a photograph generate thought from the viewers. I think an important takeaway from the article that I had was having your picture be interpretable or opinion-generating. I like the idea of treating it as a game, and having diverse enough elements that each person in a group could leave having noticed a different thing. I also like the idea of photos telling a larger story, in which the context of it can be deduced just from looking at details of the photo. I’m currently taking a different design class in which we talk about how everything is a result of its systems of production, and I feel like that’s especially relevant when it comes to photography.

                <p>I found <a href="https://www.karokonnect.com/">Karo Konnect</a> really interesting. It uses scrolls to progress through screens for each section before moving onto the next.</p>

                <h2>Modal/Overlay/Dialog Window Design</h2>
                
                <p>Pop-up windows are extremely prevalent in web design now, and I’ve definitely encountered both good and bad ones. This article shows some of the considerations that need to be made when designing a modal window, starting with a clear diagram of the basics. I think the biggest thing that stuck out to me was that an exit path should be clearly enforced. In a lot of designs that are used for marketing, exit paths are often obscured or intentionally made small. Another important takeaway is that modals aren’t the most compatible with mobile devices due to the small screen space, and that there are better alternatives to them.

                <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
                
                <p>It’s clear from reading the article that form design is something that requires a lot of consideration. While some projects are targeted towards a specific demographic, all kinds of people encounter forms, and it’s important to design them in a way that’s accessible to and intuitive to everyone. A couple of the notes that stood out to me from the article are labels, placeholder text, and explaining sensitive information. While I hadn’t thought about it in terms of form design, I can also name times where forms have asked for sensitive information and that’s made me not complete it. Another point I found important from the article was rewording so as to not blame the user when something isn’t filled out or is filled out incorrectly. Overall, the article was both interesting and informative, and I would definitely refer back to it when designing a form. 
                </p>
    
                <p>One form that stands out to me is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> checkout process. There are colorful call-to-actions, the radio buttons are kept to a small number, and there’s a clear flow regarding the order you’re supposed to fill it out.
