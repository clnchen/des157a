            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
            
            <p>It’s clear from reading the article that form design is something that requires a lot of consideration. While some projects are targeted towards a specific demographic, all kinds of people encounter forms, and it’s important to design them in a way that’s accessible to and intuitive to everyone. A couple of the notes that stood out to me from the article are labels, placeholder text, and explaining sensitive information. While I hadn’t thought about it in terms of form design, I can also name times where forms have asked for sensitive information and that’s made me not complete it. Another point I found important from the article was rewording so as to not blame the user when something isn’t filled out or is filled out incorrectly. Overall, the article was both interesting and informative, and I would definitely refer back to it when designing a form. 
            </p>

            <p>One form that stands out to me is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> checkout process. There are colorful call-to-actions, the radio buttons are kept to a small number, and there’s a clear flow regarding the order you’re supposed to fill it out.
